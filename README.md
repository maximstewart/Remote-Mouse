# Remote-Mouse
Remote Mouse is a flask + pyautogui app to control a PC from your phone or any other device.

# Fixes
* Fixed scroll direction detection.
* Fixed right click detection on release.

# Notes
* Need python 2+
* Make sure to change the port in the start script as needed. Have fun!
* For Linux you will need to do sudo -i before running the script.
